# Welcome — How This Blog Works

This is a static blog you can host on **GitHub Pages**. It takes design cues from Patreon: big hero, glass cards, and a clean grid.

## Write in Markdown
Place your articles in `/posts` as `slug.md`. Then add an entry to `/posts/posts.json` with the same `slug` plus metadata.

### Front matter? Not needed
We rely on the `posts.json` file for titles, dates, tags, and cover images.

## Table of contents
Headings (`##` and `###`) appear automatically in the right sidebar on desktop.

## Tips
- Use images by dropping them into `assets/` and referencing them with a relative path.
- Keep excerpts short (1–2 sentences).
- You can link to a post directly like `#/post/hello-world`.
